# Block-Chain-Based-Crime-Evidence-System-
The system uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to securely manage crime evidence. Role-based access lets admins assign cases and officers upload/access data via a Django interface. Immutable records ensure transparency, integrity, and traceability, enhancing justice system reliability.
Crime investigation and evidence management systems are critical components of law enforcement. However, traditional systems rely heavily on centralized databases, which are vulnerable to data tampering, unauthorized access, and lack transparency. Altering crime evidence records can lead to wrongful acquittals or convictions, undermining the justice system.
To address these vulnerabilities, this project proposes a Blockchain Based Crime Evidence System. By leveraging the decentralized and tamper-proof architecture of blockchain technology, this system ensures that crime evidence is stored securely and immutably across distributed nodes. Each evidence entry is treated as a block containing a unique hash, and any attempt to alter the data would disrupt the hash chain, thereby making tampering detectable and preventable.
The system employs Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts written in Solidity to store, retrieve, and manage evidence data. Smart contracts provide programmable, transparent, and verifiable logic for data interaction, ensuring evidence integrity throughout its lifecycle.
